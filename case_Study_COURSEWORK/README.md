## Case Study:
###### Sports and Leisure Village Registration and Booking System (VRB)
---
- Sports and Leisure Village is a nation-wide club that offers a variety of facilities for sports (such as
swimming and indoor tennis) and classes (such as yoga and fitness training) to members. The classes
are run by qualified instructors working on a full-time or part-time basis. The club requires a new
computer system to manage their members’ registration and bookings.

- New customers who wish to book the club facilities or classes should firstly be registered by a club
advisor. The club offers different types of membership, including silver, gold and platinum. The silver
membership is free to a new customer, who can then be upgraded to a gold membership if the
customer has more than 10 bookings each year. The gold membership status for a member can only be
maintained if the member has at least 10 bookings made with the club. However, the platinum
membership will require a fee of £100 a year, but members will receive discounts on bookings and
other benefits.

- A club member can book a scheduled class (led by an instructor) or the use of facility with a club
advisor. Prior to a booking, the advisor would need to be able to check the details of the classes,
facilities and their availability. The advisor would also be able to access to the above information as and
when required. The member can change or cancel a booking. The club facilities or classes can also be
booked by individuals or as a group. The booking process will produce the schedules for classes and
facilities booked. The copies of the schedules can be sent to the instructors and club managers on
request.

- Membership registration and bookings will be generally handled by the club advisors. However, the
club managers have the responsibility to oversee and authorise the matters regarding staff and the
club, which includes advisors, instructors, classes or facilities that are needed to be added to or
updated on the system.

- From the bookings of class activities, the club plans to use the information to generate invoices. The
club advisor will request the invoices with a confirmation to be sent via a post or email once the
payment is made. At the end of each month, a copy of the all invoices is transferred to the club’s
separate accounts system to be further processed.
The club would also welcome any new features recommended by the software developer.
